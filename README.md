# Nerve-detection
In this project we try to solve the ultrasound nerve segmentation problem, were we detect the nerve location in ultrasound images of a part of the neck, known as Brachial Plexus.We demonsrate to use U-net architecture to train th data along with pre-processing techniques like gaussian filter, k-means filter and gabor filter. Post-processing techniques such PCA based cleaning are been used to generate human like annotations.
